 Exploratory Data Analysis on Spotify dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## ðŸŽµ Spotify Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Leveraging Audio Features to Understand Music Popularity

---

###  **Project Overview**

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Spotify dataset** to uncover relationships between key **audio features** (such as energy, danceability, valence, and tempo) and **song popularity**.
It helps identify patterns that contribute to a trackâ€™s success and provides insights for producers and music analysts.

---

###  **Objectives**

* Analyze the distribution of major Spotify audio features.
* Understand how characteristics like **danceability** and **energy** influence **popularity**.
* Discover correlations between different features.
* Visualize key insights through histograms, scatter plots, and clustering analysis.

---

###  **Key Insights**

* Most songs have tempos between **100â€“140 BPM**, aligning with dance and pop music trends.
* **High energy and danceability** positively correlate with popularity.
* **Acousticness** and **instrumentalness** tend to be less common in popular tracks.
* **Clusters of songs** show distinct musical profiles that can guide targeted production.



###  **Technologies Used**

* **Python**
* **Pandas** â€“ Data analysis and cleaning
* **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** â€“ Clustering (KMeans, PCA)



###  **Project Files**

* `spotify.project.ipynb` â†’ Main notebook for analysis
* `Marketing.pdf` â†’ Presentation report
* Graph images (`.png` / `.jpg`) â†’ Visual insights
* `spotify-eda-project.pptx` â†’ (Optional) PowerPoint presentation
